# Getting Started w/ developping the front-end

First, download all dependencies by running the following command

```
yarn install
```

then you should be able to spin up the front-end application using this command

```
yarn start
```

Finally, you will need to mock the back-end by running this command:

```
yarn mock-backend
```

The last command will spin up a mock server that listens on port 4000. The details of the routes are located
in `mock-backend.js`.
